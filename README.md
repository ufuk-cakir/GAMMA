# Galactic Attributes of Mass, Metallicity, and Age

This project, developed by Ufuk Ã‡akir, introduces the code  to generate the GAMMA (Galactic Attributes of Mass, Metallicity, and Age) dataset, a comprehensive collection of galaxy data tailored for Machine Learning applications. 
The dataset offers detailed 2D maps and 3D cubes of 11 960 galaxies,capturing essential attributes: stellar age, metallicity, and mass. Ideal for feature extraction, clustering, and regression tasks, GAMMA offers a unique lens for exploring galac-tic structures through computational methods and is a bridge between astrophysical simulations and the field of scientific machine learning (ML)
